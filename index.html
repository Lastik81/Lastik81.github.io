<p>A HTML developer was walking down the street when he was greeted by a donkey.<br>
"Hello Mr Programmer", the donkey said, "how are you?".<br>

"Mighty fine, thank you donkey", the HTML dev replied.<br>

Immediately the donkey started crying.<br>

"What's the matter little friend?" the HTML dev asked.<br>

"I called you a programmer, at least you could call me horse" the donkey bawled.</p>
